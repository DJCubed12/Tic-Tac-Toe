# Tic-Tac-Toe
A python program that plays Tic-Tac-Toe. The program uses a user-friendly GUI and algorithmically decides the best moves to make. The algorithm takes the first turn every game. 

Unfortunately, there are somewhat rare occurances where bugs happen and the user can win. I may or may not come back to fix these some day.

Also, I wrote this code some time ago and would like to add that I now write code with a lot more readability than shown here.

Enjoy!
