# Tic-Tac-Toe
A python program that plays Tic-Tac-Toe. The program uses a user-friendly GUI (using tkinter) and algorithmically decides the best moves to make. The algorithm takes the first turn every game. 

The program requires no dependencies besides python itself. Python version 3.8 works for sure, but it should run on any version of Python 3.

Unfortunately, there are somewhat rare occurances where bugs happen and the user can win. I may or may not come back to fix these some day.

Also, I wrote this code some time ago and would like to add that I now write code with a lot more readability than shown here.

Enjoy!
